# Project Overview: Pewlett-Hackard Retirement Analysis
## Employee Retirement Eligibility and Impact on Workforce
### This project analyzes current employee data for a large company to determine the aggregate retirement eligibility status of their workforce. The purpose of the project is to help the company anticipate employee loss and describe the departmental skill sets deficit it will create in their company. 
## Creation & Implementation of Mentoring Program to Address Institutional Knowledge Loss
### The company has additionally asked for analysis help in determing employees close to retirement age with a high level of domain knowledge to identify as potential candidates for an internal mentoring program. The mentorship program is a mechanism to help the company manage the proper transfer of institutional knowledge to the incoming employees during their "Silver Tsunami". 

## Analysis Results
### Assumptions: we set our retirement eligiblity requirements as current employees born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955. 

### Comparitive Analysis of Current Workforce to Retiring Workforce

Currently there are 240,124 total employees of which 72,548 are eligible for retirement - nearly 30% of the workforce for this company will be retiring soon. This retirement bubble - the "Silver Tsunami" - creates a skill and knowledge defecit that will have enormous impacts on the companies productivity and efficiency. The company will need an aggressive plan to allocate resources needed to hire and train new staff.

### Seniority of Retiring Workforce

The mojarity of retiring employees are senior staff - %70 of the retirement eligible employees have titles of either "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff". The majority of employee loss will happen at the top of the workforce hierarchy.

### Workforce Candidates Identified for Mentorship Eligibility

Using specific employee criteria (current employees who are 10 years away from retirement eligibility), analysis dentified 1,549 employees as eligible candidates to participate in a mentorship program to help with the transfer of institutional knowledge. The 1,549 mentors would be responsible for onboarding 72,548 potential new hires, an enormous burden on a small team. If each new hire were to be assigned a mentor, that would be an average of 47 trainees per mentor.

### Internal Employees as Resources for Filling Upper Management Roles

Below is a table of current employees by title (less the retirement eligibile workforce) compared to the retirement eligible employees by title. This table helps us identify the talent pool and internal resources of employees currently working within departments that could be great potential candidates for upward mobility to fill the void in upper management roles. We can see that there are currently 21,698 engineers and 17,890 staff that could be potential candidates to fill vacancies at the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff levels.

## Analysis Summary
### Overall impact of "Silver Tsunami" in terms of total position vacancies:
A total of 72,458 roles will be vacated in the burst of the retirement bubble. It's important to note that the majority of these roles (70%) are senior staff (with "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff" titles). This will amplify the impact of vacancies and hiring needs due to the high-level skill sets and domain knowledge of the retiring group. The company will need to provide significant training for these high level hires.

### Identifying retirement-ready employees as mentorship candidates for next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees:
Through analysis we've identified 1,549 candidates to participate in the mentorship program to mentor 72,458 potential new hires. This is a ratio of 1:47. We think analysis proves that there is an inadequate resource of mentors to accomodate the incoming flux of new hires.

### Mentorship need by title:
There are no eligible managers to help train incoming managers, although the need for new managers after the Silver Tsunami is low at just 2 candidates. The mentorship candidates for senior staff and senior engineers are 2nd and 3rd highest, but with only 300 candidates for each title nearly 25,000 new hires, there will be a defecit in mentorship for these specifically high level positions.

### current employees eligible for internal upward mobility
There are currently 17,890 staff and 21,698 engineers. The companies best resource to mitigate skill loss during the Silver Tsunami is the current talent pool of employees ineligible for retirement with "staff" or "engineer" titles. These employees would make the best potential candidates to fill higher up vacancies rather than looking to hire externally as they would have a better facility to obtain neccessary job proficiency within a shorter timeframe. By elevating current employees, the company would retain institutional knowledge by filling voids in upper management with current employees. The burden of training would be dramatically lessened as it would be primarly focused on bringing entry level hires up to speed.
