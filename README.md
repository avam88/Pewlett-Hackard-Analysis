# Project Overview: Pewlett-Hackard Retirement Analysis
## Employee Retirement Eligibility and Impact on Workforce
### This project analyzes current employee data for a large company to determine the aggregate retirement eligibility status of their workforce. The purpose of the project is to help the company anticipate employee loss and describe the departmental skill sets deficit it will create in their company. 
## Creation & Implementation of Mentoring Program to Address Institutional Knowledge Loss
### The company has additionally asked for analysis help in determing employees close to retirement age with a high leve of domain knowledge to identify as potential candidates for an internal mentoring program. The mentorship program is a mechanism to help the company manage the proper transfer of institutional knowledge to the incoming employees during their retirement bubble. 

# Results: 
## Assumptions: 
### we set our retirement eligiblity requirements as current employees born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955. In this way we filtered our employee database to use only the employees that fit these criteria to return these analysis results
- Comparitive Analysis of Current Workforce to Retiring Workforce
Currently there are 240,124 total employees of which 72,548 are eligible for retirement - nearly 30% of the workforce for this company will be retiring soon. This retirement bubble - the "Silver Tsunami" - creates a skill and knowledge defecit that will have enormous impacts on the companies productivity and efficiency. The company will need an aggressive plan to allocate resources needed to hire and train new staff.
- Seniority of Retiring Workforce
The mojarity of retiring employees are senior staff - %70 of the retirement eligible employees have titles of either "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff". The majority of employees lost is happening at the top of the workforce hierarchy.

- Workforce Candidates Identified for Mentorship Eligibility
Using specific employee criteria (current employees who are 10 years away from retirement eligibility and have been with the company since 1965), analysis dentified 1,549 employees as eligible candidates to participate in a mentorship program to help with the transfer of institutional knowledge. There are 1,549 mentroship candidates to help train and mentor new hires to fill 72,548 vacancies, which is an enormous burden on a small team. If each new hire were to be assigned a mentor, that would be an average of 47 trainees per mentor.

- Internal Employees as Resources for Filling Upper Management Roles
Below is a table of current employees by title less the retirement eligibile workforce. This table helps us identify the talent pool and internal resources of employees currently working within departments that could be great potential candidates for upward mobility to fill void in upper management roles. We can see that there are currently 21,698 engineers and 17,890 staff that could be potential candidates to fill vacancies at the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff levels.

# Summary:
## How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
A total of 72,458 roles will be vacated in burst of the retirement bubble. It's important to note that the majority of these roles (70%) are senior staff (with "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff" titles). This will amplify the impact of vacancies and hiring needs due to the high-level skill sets and domain knowledge of the retiring group. The company will need to provide significant training for these high level hires.
## Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Through analysis we've identified 1,549 candidates to participate in the mentorship program to mentor 41,380 potential new hires. This is a ratio of 1:47. We think analysis proves that there is an inadequate resource of mentors to accomodate for the incoming flux of new hires.

## comparitive need between mentors and mentees:
There are no eligible managers to help train incoming managers, although the need for new managers after silver tsunami is low at just 2 candidates. The mentorship candidates for senior staff and senior engineers are 2nd and 3rd highest, but with only 300 candidates for each title nearly 25,000 new hires, there will be a defecit in mentorship for these specifically high level positions.
## current employees eligible for internal upward mobility
there are currently __ staff and __ engineers. These employees would make the best potential candidates to fill the upper roles rather than external hires. Plenty of currently employees to elevate. This would decrease the pressure of intense training for external hires. In this way retain institutional domain knowledge by filling voids in upper management with current employees and instead squeeze the hiring need skewed towards the entry level positions which are easier to hire and train for.
